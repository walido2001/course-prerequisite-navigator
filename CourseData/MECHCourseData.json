        "Mechanical Engineering: Professionalism and Society",
        "In this course, students explore their role in the profession of mechanical engineering and the relationship between mechanical engineering and society. Students learn about the role of engineering in society, human-centred design principles, working with communities, and technological stewardship principles. These are applied through a major project completed outside of the classroom (e.g. in partnership with a local community or external organization). The course also focuses on various career paths and opportunities, e.g. options in government, private industry, not-for-profit sector, graduate education, entrepreneurial opportunities and technology protection. Students are required to build their professional network, for example, through attending networking events and conducting informational interviews. Finally, this course discusses the professional matters including the value of diversity, allyship in the workplace, life-long learning strategies, working in teams, and giving & receiving feedback. Guest lecturers from industry and other appropriate bodies will be used to provide a firsthand knowledge from practicing engineers and other professionals. ",
