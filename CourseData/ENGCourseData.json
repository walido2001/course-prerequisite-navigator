This course, is designed to help students harness their creative potential by stimulating their own creative process, in order to help them develop ideas that create real value and have a positive impact on society. Creativity can be applied across many disciplines, and this course is designed for students from all faculties, with enhanced learning opportunities fostered through projects delivered in cross disciplinary teams. The course will help students learn how to observe and frame critical problems, and then identify and choose potential solutions that can be implemented by individuals or organizations. As a consequence of participating in this course, students will become an innovation enabler in any type of organization, or better able to use their own creativity to create a startup. Students will start by exploring their own creativity and problem solving style, before being introduced to creative problems solving frameworks, tools and processes, which they can deploy while solving real problems, both individually and in teams.
