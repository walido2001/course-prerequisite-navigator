        "In this course, students explore their role in the profession of mechanical engineering and the relationship between mechanical engineering and society. Students learn about the role of engineering in society, human-centred design principles, working with communities, and technological stewardship principles. These are applied through a major project completed outside of the classroom (e.g. in partnership with a local community or external organization). The course also focuses on various career paths and opportunities, e.g. options in government, private industry, not-for-profit sector, graduate education, entrepreneurial opportunities and technology protection. Students are required to build their professional network, for example, through attending networking events and conducting informational interviews. Finally, this course discusses the professional matters including the value of diversity, allyship in the workplace, life-long learning strategies, working in teams, and giving & receiving feedback. Guest lecturers from industry and other appropriate bodies will be used to provide a firsthand knowledge from practicing engineers and other professionals. ",

This course will focus mainly at covering important introductory concept to understand solution chemistry including reactivity, thermochemistry, structure and properties of materials. The course is divided in six sections. The first section covers an introduction to the topic of Materials Science and its impact on our daily lives as well as future trends and review key chemistry concepts required for this course. The second section will present the states of matter (gas, liquid and solid), their physical characteristics and the forces holding materials together (bonding and intermolecular forces). The third section will expend on the liquid phase and properties of solutions including equilibrium, solubility, pH and pKa. The fourth section will deal with thermochemistry and its first law with an emphasis on enthalpy as well as phase changes and phase diagrams. Section six will present an introduction to the properties of solids (electronic and mechanical) and criteria in the selection of materials will also be discussed. Section seven will present in more details structure-properties and processing of soft materials (natural and artificial polymer) in the context of the material covered in the other sections. ",

Qualified Honours students gain relevant work experience as an integrated complement to their academic studies, reflected in the requirements of a learning agreement and work term report. Students are required to register in this course for each four month work term, with the maximum number of work term courses being four ( i.e. 16 months). Students in this course receive assistance from the Career Centre prior to and during their internship, and are also assigned a Faculty Supervisor/Committee. ",
